# Autonomous weather station for paragliding

This project is meant to be delivered to a paragliding association in order to allow them to have weather information through SMS, walkie-talkie and Internet (FFVL website). 
The aim is to strengthen the system (software and hardware) in order to improve the batteryâ€™s life, make it more resistant to the outdoor environment and improve the system integration.
